Simple c++ program for managing library
With this program you can:
  1. Add books
  2. Add members
  3. View all members or view seperatly via member id that member is given during adding him
  4. The same thing happens to books
  5. Delete members
  6. Delete Books
  7. Members can boorow and return books and error will be shown if given book is already borrowed
Feel free to use that code. I will be updating it if i found bugs and maybe in the future i will give option to add members and books from txt file and save to txt file and also maybe i will try to do ui using sfml
